This version of DirectSlave was modified by
Dmitry Shilyaev (justhost.ru), dima@justhost.ru

UPDATES:

1. Created wrapper around rndc. Because DirectSlave reloads named on EVERY
   zone update, we need to have some buffer to accumulate changes on massive updates.
   New command smartreload, added in cron to apply accumulated changes.

2. Added support for 'exists' request from DirectAdmin.
